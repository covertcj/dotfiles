# dotfiles

These are my current dotfiles (or at least some of them). Maybe someday I'll
add useful documentation for myself and others.

## Keyboards for Power Users / The Hyper Key

These dotfiles have a a hyper key config for Linux, MacOS, and Windows via
KMonad, Karabiner, and AutoHotkey. The KMonad config is the least fleshed out,
but I think I want to migrate them all to that in the long term.

## cli-tools

These are my experiments with rust and shell scripting. I've used bash/zsh/fish
configs across a few different machines/work environments and want something
more portable, so I've been experimenting with using `rust` and `xshell` as a
possible replacement for the stuff I use all the time.

## emacs / doom

I use doom emacs mainly, but also have an old standalone emacs config that may
or may not work.

## terminals / kitty / alacritty

Both of these are awesome projects. I randomly switch between the two and love
both. Neither of my configs change much aside from theming or fonts. I encourage
checking them both out, depending on your needs.

## regolith

These are outdated regolith 1.x configs. I'm still experimenting with v2.
